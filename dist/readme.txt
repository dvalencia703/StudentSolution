Ex: java studentSolution input.csv name=leia
Ex: java studentSolution input.csv type=kinder
Ex: java studentSolution input.csv type=elementary gender=female
Use the create student methods to create each student from the CSV file in your business objects.
Echo the results of the requested search operation to the console (system.out)
JSON was used by the outcome of a searching.
